Hi Jorien,

I've made the following changes:


done:

  - ALL:
     - headers:
        - added the version nr.:
           - it is now shown as "transparent" text next to the logo's text in the top-leftmost corner
           - e.g. latest version should be = "v20221124.g"
           - this is just a dummy value for now .. to see which version is showing up in the browser
     - footers:
        - removed the version nr.
        - added the action to open your LinkedIn page when the "In" logo is clicked:
           - this opens in a new tab/window

  - MAIN:
     - 1st pic:
        - used "foto main page colour shopped whitewash.jpg"
        - cropped it to 3500*1050px
     - 2nd pic:
        - used the pen-logo here
        - i.e. ipv the 2nd facepic
     - text:
        - minor mods, as specified in "teksten website (1).docx"
        - changed the hyperlink for the word ".. Neem [contact] met me ..":
            - since the "Contact" page won't exist anymore
            - pointed it to the "Tarieven" page instead
     - opdrachtgevers:
        - re-added this section as a placeholder (for now)
        - need to add the logos and arrows here still
     - testimonials:
        - changed it such that the text appears all at once, ipv fade-in word-by-word
        - changed the company for Martine from "ABN AMRO" => "Way Beyond Compare"

  - PEN:
     - 1st pic:
        - used "foto pen page whitewash.jpg"
